# sample websocket message sender
Start the server by running node server.js.

Open Postman and create a new WebSocket request by clicking on "New" and selecting "WebSocket Request".

Enter ws://localhost:8080 as the URL and click on "Connect".

Type some text in the "Send a message" field and click on "Send".

The server should print the received message in the console.

Regarding the bonus question, there are other approaches that can be better than using WebSockets in terms of performance. One such approach is to use a real-time database like Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore, which allows you to synchronize data in real-time across multiple devices without the need for a WebSocket server. Another approach is to use a serverless function like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to handle the data synchronization. This can be more cost-effective and scalable, as the serverless functions can be automatically scaled based on the demand.


# Open Questions 
1. What is your approach to debugging the backend application? The answer should contain a few cases from your experience.
    # Answer: 
    # Here are some common approaches to debugging backend applications:

    # Reproduce the error: 
    Before debugging a problem, it's important to be able to reproduce the error consistently. 
    This helps you to isolate the issue and narrow down the root cause.

    # Check the logs: 
    Logs are a valuable source of information for understanding what's happening in the application. 
    Reviewing logs can provide insights into what code is being executed, 
    what data is being processed, and any errors or exceptions that have occurred.

    # Use a debugger: 
    Debuggers allow you to step through code and inspect variables and data structures as the code is executing. 
    This can be useful for identifying the exact point at which an error occurs.

    # Break the code into smaller pieces:
    If the code is complex, it may be helpful to break it into smaller pieces to isolate the issue. 
    This can involve temporarily removing code or introducing print statements to narrow down the area where the error is occurring.

    # Use automated testing: 
    Automated testing can help catch errors before they make it into production. By running automated tests, 
    you can ensure that changes to the codebase do not introduce new errors.

    # Consult documentation: 
    Many backend frameworks and libraries have extensive documentation that can help you troubleshoot issues. 
    Reviewing documentation can provide insights into common issues, potential solutions, and best practices.

    # Collaborate with others: 
    Debugging can be challenging, so it's important to collaborate with others when possible. 
    This can include asking for help from colleagues, seeking advice on forums or online communities, 
    or hiring a consultant or contractor with expertise in the specific area that's causing problems.

2. What are migrations in a database? Why they are important? Describe how you would solve the data type conversion, 
    and character set mismatch issues when applying schema conversion and data migration. 

    # Answer
    Migrations in a database are the process of updating the database schema, including tables, columns, constraints, indexes, and other objects,
     to match changes in the application's data model. Migrations help ensure that the database is up-to-date with the latest changes and can support
      new features and functionality.

    Migrations are important for several reasons, including:

    # Maintaining data integrity: 
    By updating the database schema, migrations help ensure that data is stored correctly and can be accessed and 
    modified by the application as expected.

    # Enabling new features: 
    Migrations can introduce new tables, columns, or constraints that support new application features and functionality.

    # Consistency: 
    Migrations help ensure consistency across database instances and deployments, making it easier to deploy changes 
    and manage the database over time.

    # To solve data type conversion and character set mismatch issues when applying schema conversion and data migration, the following approaches can be used:

    # Data type conversion: 
    When converting data types, it's important to ensure that the new data type is compatible with the existing data 
    and that data loss does not occur. One way to address this is to use a tool or script that automatically converts the data type, 
    taking into account any constraints or other dependencies. Another approach is to manually update the data type, making sure to 
    review all affected data and ensuring that no data is lost or corrupted.

    # Character set mismatch: 
    Character set mismatches can occur when migrating data between databases with different character sets, such as from a Latin-based 
    character set to a Unicode character set. To address this, the data can be converted to the appropriate character set before migrating 
    it to the new database. This can be done using a tool or script that automatically converts the data or manually by reviewing all 
    affected data and ensuring that no data is lost or corrupted.

    # In both cases,
     it's important to thoroughly test the migration process to ensure that the data is migrated correctly and that the application continues 
     to function as expected after the migration. Backing up the database before the migration is also recommended to avoid any data loss in
     case of unforeseen issues.
